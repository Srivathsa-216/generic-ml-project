## Introduction

The Generic ML Project repository is designed to provide a standardized approach to organizing and managing machine learning projects. It covers various aspects such as project structure, data management, model development, evaluation, deployment, and more.

## Project Structure

A typical project structure for a machine learning project may include the following directories:

1. **data**: Contains raw and processed data used for training and evaluation.
2. **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and experimentation.
3. **scripts**: Python scripts for preprocessing data, training models, and evaluating performance.
4. **models**: Saved model artifacts and trained model files.
5. **tests**: Unit tests and integration tests for validating code and models.
6. **docs**: Documentation files, including project documentation, READMEs, and tutorials.

## Technologies and Tools

The Generic ML Project utilizes a variety of technologies and tools commonly used in machine learning projects, including but not limited to:

- Python programming language
- NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn libraries for data manipulation and modeling
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis and prototyping
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Docker for containerization and reproducibility
- Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Travis CI or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment
